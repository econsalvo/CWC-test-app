# Vite App

This is a Vite-powered app. Vite is a modern build tool that focuses on speed and simplicity.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 16.8 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Comes with Node.js)

You can verify if you have Node.js and npm installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If you don't have Node.js or npm installed, download and install them from the official website.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Vite app, cd into the coldwater-app directory then follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages required to run the app.

### 3. Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and you should see output like this:

```
  VITE vX.X.X  ready in Xms

  > Local:    http://localhost:3000/
  > Network:  use --host to expose
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app running.

### 4. Build the App for Production

To build the app for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `dist/` directory.

### 5. Preview the Production Build

To preview the production build locally, you can run:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will start a local server that serves the production build, allowing you to test the final output before deploying.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production build.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues while running the app, consider the following:

- Ensure your Node.js version is compatible with the project.
- Delete the `node_modules/` directory and reinstall dependencies:

  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules
  npm install
  ```

- Clear npm cache (if necessary):

  ```bash
  npm cache clean --force
  ```

## Deployment

For deployment, you can use various platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Follow the platform-specific guides to deploy your Vite app.
